# Handling JSON Decoding Errors and Null Values in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when working with JSON data: handling potential `FormatException` errors from `jsonDecode` and dealing with null or empty JSON responses.  The `bug.dart` file shows the initial problematic code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a robust solution.

## Problem:
The original code assumes a successful JSON response with at least one element. It doesn't handle cases where:

1. The API request fails (non-200 status code).
2. The response body is not valid JSON.
3. The JSON array is empty.
4. The JSON is null.

These scenarios can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution:
The improved code in `bugSolution.dart` includes comprehensive error handling and null checks to prevent these issues. It uses `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions and checks for null or empty JSON data before attempting to access elements.
